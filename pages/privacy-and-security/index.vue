                            <p>We respect the privacy of our members and customers. This Privacy and Security Statement is designed to help you understand what information we gather and how we use it. In our ongoing effort to improve the services and features we provide to our members and customers, My Secret Drawer / Now 4 Group will continue to implement new technologies from time to time. As a result, this policy is subject to change without prior notice. We encourage you to review our privacy and security policy periodically.</p>
                            <p><strong>YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY—THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</strong></p>
                            <p>The type of information we gather online falls into five general categories:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Aggregate Site Usage Information</li>
                            <li>Online Order Information</li>
                            <li>Voluntary Registered Shopper Information</li>
                            <li>Click-Stream Data</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>AGGREGATE SITE USAGE INFORMATION</strong></p>
                            <p>We collect and store information about the pages viewed by all of our website visitors. We then use this data in aggregate form to identify overall visitor behavior patterns. Our objective in using this information is to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users.</p>
                            <p>Our data servers automatically collect anonymous information about every visitor to our site/sites, including your computer&#8217;s internet protocol (IP) address. This IP address allows us to identify your computer on the internet so that the online content you request can be sent back to your computer.</p>
                            <p>We analyze this information to determine the level of processing power we need in order to meet visitor expectations. From time to time, we may also provide portions of this aggregate, anonymous site behavior information to suppliers, consultants and or advertisers. Our purpose is to ensure maximum purchasing power through the demonstration of site ‘traffic’.</p>
                            <p><strong>YOUR ONLINE ORDER INFORMATION AND VOLUNTARY REGISTERED SHOPPER INFORMATION</strong></p>
                            <p>If you choose to purchase products from the My Secret Drawer web site, we require the following information in order to fulfill your order: We request an e-mail address during the order process so that we can send an e-mail confirmation message acknowledging the receipt of your order. This message contains your name, address, My Secret membership number (if applicable), the list of items you purchased, an order reference number, a confirmation of your shipping method, and the total amount of items requested. Please note that this confirmation e-mail does NOT contain your credit card number.</p>
                            <p><strong>CLICK-STREAM DATA</strong></p>
                            <p>On a Web site, click-stream data (also called click-stream analytics and/or click-stream analysis) is the process of collecting, analyzing and reporting aggregate data about which pages a website visitor visits &#8212; and in what order. The path the visitor takes though a website is called the click-stream. We track this data in order to improve, in-aggregate, your onsite experience.</p>
